                <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>To Her Excellency,<br>Calla of Johannesburg</b></p>
    
                <p>On the afternoon of 28th October 2025, I received a letter from your respectable messenger which goes by the name “gifft”. Although at first I was rather disappointed by such informality and bewildered at the courage it took to address me this way, I was left speechless by the time I had finished reading through it. </p>
    
                <p>I will address the cats first, as is only proper given their status. Royalty takes precedence over all other matters, including declarations of affection. The two cats sitting in the fog was a pretty good pick. I’d like to assume the symbolism was intentional. Though I would note that if I am the black cat in your photograph, the white cat appears to have its view partially obstructed by those bushes. Perhaps an oversight in the metaphor? Or are you suggesting that your perspective has natural limitations? I am uncertain which interpretation you intended but both are interesting.</p>
    
                <p>I am very grateful you chose not to produce the complete book of reasons. International shipping costs aside, I would have then been obligated to respond with equal length, as a book can only accept a book in return. Thank you for sparing us both considerable amounts of effort.  Instead you listed a set of claims and identified me as happiness and light, someone who makes you yearn for connection. I note your use of 'yearn' specifically, given our history with that word and the confusion when you sent a screenshot definition instead of just speaking plainly. You mentioned things you love from my nerdy outlook to what you generously call my cute smile, mentioned my advanced humor and complete ignorance of trending topics as if both are features. You invoked yin and yang, declared me part of your daily routine, and stated you would not have it any other way. These arrived with two cats in the morning mist. I read it, all of it.  It was a very effective presentation, I’ll give you that. Thank you for writing it, it really means a lot.</p>
    
                <p>I like your positivity in ways I still am unable to fully articulate. You approach situations with an optimism that should be unrealistic but somehow produces results, which violates my understanding of probability theory. I like how understanding you are when I process things slowly or spend a day procrastinating about responding back. You give me time and space without making it feel like patience, though well clearly it is patience. I like that you work hard at everything you commit yourself to, whether it is academics or connection or deciding which song belongs on a playlist as if the fate of nations depends on track order. Not to mention, I enjoy your chaos, the typos that arrive at 11pm and make me question if you own a functional keyboard. The way you get passionate about things that interest you and expect me to keep up as if I have unlimited processing capacity. I like your hair, though for some reason this has become another likeable thing that I have no logical reasoning for. You have a permanent place here and I am not interested in debating terms or definitions. You stay and it is not up for discussion.</p>
